## Description

This contact printer is designed to make 16mm prints using affordable electronics and 3D printing.
It is *not* intended as a replacement for professional printers like the Bell & Howell Model C.
This project is for DIY filmmakers, independent artists and small film labs to have a machine that can produce reasonable-quality work prints with a small footprint on short lengths of film easily.
